The user has given me a task where I have to return just the verse text without any extra stuff like book references or version labels. First, let's break down what they're asking for. They want me to act as a database retrieval engine. That means my job is to take the input, process it, and output only the verse text accurately. The example provided shows that when the input is \"John 11:35\" with the King James Version (1769), the correct output is just \"Jesus wept.\" without any quotes or additional information. So, I need to make sure I follow this format strictly. I should start by understanding the structure of the verse reference. The user provided \"John 11:35,\" which refers to John chapter 11, verse 35. In the King James Version, that verse is indeed \"Jesus wept.\" So, my task is to extract just that part without any surrounding text or references. I also need to consider other possible inputs. For example, if someone asks for a different version or a different verse, I should still follow the same rule: output only the verse text verbatim. No extra quotes,",
