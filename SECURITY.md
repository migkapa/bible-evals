# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue. If the repository has GitHub Security
Advisories enabled, use that to report privately. If not, open an issue with
minimal details and request a private channel from the maintainers.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided on the `main` branch only.
